# Overview
This Capstone Project is part of the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google (Nov 10 - 14, 2025) and is open to all participants. The project lets you apply what you’ve learned during the course by building AI agents in one of four tracks: Concierge Agents, Agents for Good, Enterprise Agents or Freestyle. Submissions are due by Dec 1, 2025, 11:59 AM PT, and top projects will win Kaggle swag, social media recognition on Kaggle’s platforms and all participants will receive a Kaggle badge and certificate.

# Description
This capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned during the course week and submit it for evaluation.

The high level process for a capstone project consists of:
1. Selecting a track (and only one track) from one of the four options. This will scope the problem/use case for your project. {Example: Concierge Agents}
2. Formulating a problem and solution pitch to which you will build your agent. This will hone the objective of your project. {Example: Writing blogs is too manual and time intensive. I will be building an Automated Blog Writer Agent to scale my blog production and blog quality.}
3. Developing and publishing the code for your agent publicly. {Example: Publishing the agent code to GitHub or Kaggle Notebooks.}
4. Being able to articulate the value of the agent by preparing a writeup. {Example: This agent reduced my blog writing process by 10 hours per week.}
5. For bonus points, publishing a video related to the project.
6. Submitting a writeup to this competition no later than December 1, 2025, 11:59 AM (Pacific Time). Check out "How Do I Make A Submission section" below.

# Timeline
- Submissions are due no later than December 1, 2025, 11:59 AM (Pacific Time).

# Working as a Team
- Your team can only make one submission for the capstone project.
- You can submit as an individual participant - a team of one (1); or submit as a member of a team with the team having no more than four (4) members.
- Each participant can only be in at most one team.
- If you’d like to form a team or join an existing one, join Kaggle Discord and connect with other participants.

# Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated on three categories earning up to a maximum of 100 points.
- Category 1: The Pitch (max 30 points)
- Category 2: The Implementation (max 70 points)
- Bonus: (max 20 points)

Note: Bonus points are added to the total of Category 1 and 2 points, up to a maximum of total 100 points.

Example scoring evaluation: Category 1 score of 30 points + Category 2 score of 60 points + Bonus points of 20 = 100 points.
